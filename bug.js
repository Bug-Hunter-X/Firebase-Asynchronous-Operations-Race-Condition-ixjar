The following code snippet demonstrates a common error when using Firebase's Realtime Database in conjunction with asynchronous operations:

```javascript
function updateDatabase(data) {
  firebase.database().ref('/myData').set(data).then(() => {
    console.log('Data updated successfully!');
  }).catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error updating data:', error);
  });

  // ... more code that might depend on data being updated ...
  console.log('This line may execute before the data is updated!');
}
```

The issue lies in the fact that the `set()` method is asynchronous. The line `console.log('This line may execute before the data is updated!')` might execute before the data is actually written to the database, leading to unexpected behavior.
